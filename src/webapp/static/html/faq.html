            <h2>What is the dresscode?</h2>
            Not a suit &amp; tie kind of event. There might be a vest. It'll be fairly casual.
            <h2>Where can I Park?</h2>
            Street parking is available. If street parking is filled when you arrive, garage parking is available nearby at 300 Neil Ave.
            <h2>What's for Dinner?</h2>
            <div>Catering is provided by Chef Jordy Owens of <a href="http://www.espelettecatering.com/">Espelette Catering</a>.</div>
            <div>Vegetarian and Vegan offerings will be available.</div>
            <h2>Should I bring a Gift?</h2>
            We have been building a life together for a few years now, and are fortunate to have all the handtowels and pyrex dishes and candles that we could ever need. The best gift you can bring us is yourself!
            
            However, if you can't bear the thought of showing up empty-handed, feel free to bring or send any of the following:
            <ul>
                <li>A bottle of your favorite wine</li>
                <li>A copy of your favorite book</li>
                <li>A donation to <a href="https://womenhaveoptions.nationbuilder.com/give_the_gift_of_access">Women Have Options</a> or <a href="https://donate.doctorswithoutborders.org/onetime.cfm">Doctors Without Borders</a></li>
