            <h2>A note from Buxi</h2>
            
            <p>The beginning of our relationship is just one retelling of a tale as old as time, or at least as old as dial-up: two people matching on a dating website, and meeting at a bar.</p>        
            <p>I didn't trust my car to deliver me to a first date, so I picked a bar close to my apartment. We met up at Ethyl & Tank for drinks, and by the end of the night, I'd made a few assessments about Chris: 1.) he was even prettier than his photos, 2.) he was even more engaging than his messages, 3.) he wasn't in a position to drive home, and 4.) he probably wasn't an axe murderer. So, I walked him home with me.</p>            
            <p>My apartment wasn't, like, AirBnB material. It had cockroaches and mice and serious HVAC problems. It was also noisy that night - not from rowdy neighbors or anything, but from my retching as the “Tank nachos” gave me food poisoning. But I guess he still had a nice time because he kept coming back over to see me, and the moment I got a new (clean) place he migrated his computer into it, which was basically the same as moving in.</p>            
            <p>Since then, he's taught me a lot about how to build emotionally healthy relationships, how to see past my own self-imposed limitations, and how to approach physics problems. He's also helped me ditch my car, supported me through my journey to medical school, put a gorgeous ring on my finger, and bought us a house. In return, I've taught him how to fill nail holes in drywall, how to get an abortion in Ohio, and a whole bunch of other stuff he could've easily googled or otherwise didn't need to know. I also gave him a piñata once. I'm not totally sure what he's getting out of this, but s/o to anyone who’s ever broken up with this guy (why???) because he's an impossible treasure and I can't believe he’s gonna marry me.</p>
